# Development

To work on the lysbot-merge action:

```bash
cd .github/actions/lysbot-merge
npm ci
# Make your code changes...
npm run all     # Run all fix, check, and package steps
```

Individual commands for specific tasks:

```bash
npm run test:coverage  # Run unit tests with coverage
npm run format:write   # Run formatter (format:check for checking only)
npm run lint           # Run ESLint
npm run bundle         # Bundle with rollup
```

## Architecture and Code Structure

For detailed information about the architectural design, module structure, and design principles, please refer to **[Architecture.md](./Architecture.md)**.

### Quick Reference

- **Architecture Pattern**: Modular Monolith with Pure DI
- **Entry Point**: `src/index.ts` (loads `main.ts`)
- **Composition Root**: `src/main.ts` (DI + orchestration only)
- **Module Structure**: See [Architecture.md](./Architecture.md#module-structure)
- **Design Principles**: See [Architecture.md](./Architecture.md#design-principles)

### Code Quality and Naming

For general refactoring principles, naming conventions, and module organization guidelines, see the **[Code Quality Guidelines](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md#code-quality-guidelines)** section in CONTRIBUTING.md.

## Input Handling

For GitHub Actions input handling guidelines (including DEPRECATED and OPTIONAL prefix rules), see the **[GitHub Actions Development](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md#github-actions-development)** section in CONTRIBUTING.md.

# Testing

This action uses **Vitest** for unit testing. The test suite focuses on testing pure logic functions and mocking GitHub API interactions for isolation.

| Test Type             | Status             | Description                                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unit Tests**        | ✅ Implemented     | Covers command parsing, permissions, merge logic, and API interactions |
| **Integration Tests** | ❌ Not implemented | Would test GitHub API interactions with real tokens                    |
| **E2E Tests**         | ❌ Not implemented | Would test full workflow execution on real PRs                         |

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```
